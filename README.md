## F.A.Q.

- I found a bug!    
Great, if you know how to use GitHub then you can create a [new issue on the repository](https://github.com/Marneus68/dViz_Tools_jsx/issues). Don't forget to mention the version of Illustrator, the OS you're running it on and any specific informations that could be used to reproduce the bug.
